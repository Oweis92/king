<h1>1</h1> <h2>The white player makes the first move.</h2>
<p>They choose any piece they'd like to move to
 begin the initial attack, or the opening.
 They move a piece, and black counters. 
 The opening is one of the most important parts of the game.
 There's no real "right" way to do it --
 everyone has their own style and 
 you'll find yours. But there are a few things to keep in mind:</p>
 
<ul> 
<li>Do not go about about attacking for now. In your opening, you're just getting your pieces to their most useful posts.
 You want them to be on good and safe squares.</li>
 <li>Generally, make only 1 or 2 moves with your pawns. Then start concentrating on your more powerful pieces -- bishops,
 knights, queen, and rooks. "Development" 
 (getting your pieces to active squares, such as the center)
 isn't complete until all of these pieces have moved.</li>
 <li>A lot of your opening moves depend on your opponent -- you'll just have to feel out the game. 
 So observe and see if you can guess what his plan is. 
 This game is more about anticipating threats and foresight than anything else.</li>

</ul>

<h1>2</h1> <h2>Incorporate the "en passant" rule.</h2>
<p> If you'd like, that is. Plenty of beginners don't worry about it.
 But if you're curious as to how to make this game a little more French and 
 a little more complicated than it already is, why, here's how:</p>
 <ul> 
<li>If you recall, your pawn can move 2 spaces forward on its first move. Let's say you do just that, 
landing next to your opponent's pawn, on the same row. On the next move -- and only the next move -- 
your opponent can capture your pawn en passant (which literally translates to: in passing).
 Normally, pieces can only capture by moving into the square that had been occupied by that enemy piece -- 
 but this is an exceptional case where the enemy pawn moves into the square that the pawn has passed over
 and still captures that pawn.</li>
<li>Again, this can only happen right after a pawn has made its initial 2-space move.
 If a turn goes by, the opportunity is lost. This move is unique only to the pawns and no other piece. 
Thus you cannot capture with the queen or a knight by en passant.</li>
</ul>
<hr>


<h1>3</h1> <h2>Take turns.</h2>
<p>
And thus goes the game! You and your opponent take turns, trying to get to each other's king and capturing pieces in your wake.
 If you can threaten their queen or king and keep him on the defensive, you'll be at an advantage, 
but there are infinite possibilities as to how to win.</p>

<ul> 
<li>Pawns may seem like they're just in the way, but don't be tempted to sacrifice them just yet.
 If you get a pawn to the other side of the board, it immediately gets promoted into another piece
 (just not the king)! Naturally one would choose a queen, but in rare cases, one may choose a knight 
 or a rook or even a bishop. If you can sneak your pawn to the other side without your opponent noticing,
 you can change the tide of the game completely.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>4</h1> <h2>Always think a step or two in advance.</h2>
<p> f you move your knight there, what happens? Does it expose other pieces 
for your opponent's next play? Do you have time to play offense or does your
 king (or maybe even queen) need protecting? What ideas seem to be brewing on your opponent's turf?
 Where do you see the game going in the next few moves?</p>
<ul> 
<li>This isn't a game where you can mindlessly move pieces around -- 
they all affect each other in one way or another. You'll have a pawn 
in the way of your bishop's attack, you'll have your knight defending
 your king, and your opponent's rook is about to jump on your queen if you don't do
 something about it. So plan your next move and the one after that -- and your opponent's moves if you can, too. 
To win, you must be tactful and strategic!</li>
<li>Always have a comeback move, if possible. You can place your pawn at the will 
of your opponent's bishop if that means you can then take his bishop with your knight.
 Sometimes well-planned sacrifices must be made.</li>
 
</ul>

<hr>

<h1>5</h1> <h2>Know how to "castle".</h2>
<p>There is a special move involving both the rook and the King. It is the only
 time you can move two pieces in the same turn. Apart from the pawn's en passant move,
 one other special move is castling. That's when your rook and your king exchange places -- 
 it shelters the king and gets your rook developed and ready to join the action. It is generally
 useful to have your king castled.</p>
<ul> 
<li>You can use your castle only if :</li>

<ul>
<li>Neither the King nor the Rook to be castled have moved.</li>
<li>The King is not in check.</li>
<li>There are no pieces between the King and the rook.</li>
<li>The king does not pass over or end up on a square that is in the control of an enemy piece.</li>

<img src="Capture8.jpg"height="500"width="900" vspace="20" hspace="50"border="5" title="sos">

<li>In one turn, you move both your king and your rook. First move the king, 
two squares toward the rook, and then place the rook in the square adjacent to 
the king on the other side. If you castle on the Kingside, the rook moves a total 
of two squares. If you castle on the Queenside,
 the rook moves a total of three squares.</li>
<li>The King is not in check.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h1>6</h1> <h2>Win the game by checkmating your opponent's king.</h2>
<p>That means you've got the king in check but this time there's no escape. 
When this happens, saying, "Checkmate!" is acceptable, but not necessary.
At this point your opponent taps over his king so that it falls and signals defeat.</p>
<ul> 
<li>Stalemates do happen -- when the ends in a draw. 
This is when the player whose turn it is to move is not in check but has no legal moves with the king or any other piece.</li>
<li>There are a few other ways by which a game can end in a draw.</li>

<ul>
<li>By agreement. If both players agree that they can no longer win or see a method to win, they can agree to draw.</li>
<li>By repetition. If the same exact position of the chess board, 
occurs at three different points in a game, the game is declared a draw.
 For example, if both players just keep moving their Knights back and forth to the same squares, 
 the game will be declared a draw.</li>
<li>By the 50 move rule. If neither player makes a pawn move or captures a piece for 50 consecutive moves, 
the game will be declared as a draw. This prevents player from playing endlessly, or to tire the other player out.</li>
<li>By insufficient material. If neither player has sufficient material to checkmate the king, the game is 
considered a draw. For example, a Knight and a King alone cannot checkmate the lone enemy King.</li>
<li>If all other pieces except the kings are captured and are off the board. This is an example of insufficient 
material and a King cannot checkmate or check the other king all by himself. The game will end as a draw.</li>
